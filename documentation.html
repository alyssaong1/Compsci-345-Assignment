					<hr ALIGN="LEFT">
					<div align="center"><img src="colourscheme.png" style="padding:30px 0;height:400px;"></div>
					<p class="postcontent"><b>Colour scheme:</b> Complementary<br><br>
					<b>Darkest blue:</b> Use as headers for posts and also the background colour for the navbar and top half of some pages with eye grabbing information.
<br><br><b>Middle blue:</b> Use for buttons on the page. 
<br><br><b>Light blue:</b> Use for less significant parts of headers (the smaller headers) and dates e.g. the date on blog posts and the expiry date of the offer.
<br><br><b>Golden:</b> Use as smaller headers against the darkest blue.
<br><br>Forming teams for the season should be a hyped up and exciting activity and this complimentary colour scheme will reflect it. The top half contains exciting information for the user, and the inverse contrast from the white and gold font on a dark blue background emphasises this. The dark blue used is at the lower end of the spectrum, so that the headers for the content are comfortable to look at. The buttons are a middle blue so that they are eye catching but still comfortable to look at.

					<h3 class="posttitle">Lines, Border and Background</h3>
					<hr ALIGN="LEFT"><br>
					<p class="postcontent">Add a shadow on the borders for the upper dark blue half for some of the pages, and button borders to make them stand out (literally) and to make the page look multidimensional and exciting. Thin and dark gold borders around the 'cards' create the physical grouping separating chunks of information out. Hairline for the news articles to separate the headings and the content. The rounded corners of the card give the site a more lively and exciting feel. The cards are only used for the main content, segmenting the page into a 75:25 ratio.

					<h3 class="posttitle">Font Scheme</h3>
					<hr ALIGN="LEFT"><br>
					<p class="postcontent">Fonts used: Montserrat and Open Sans<br><br>
Montserrat is used for key headings, especially headings that specify the information grouping on the page (e.g. Latest SQRL News, 2015 Team lineup). Montserrat is nicely spaced which makes it easy to read, and looks modern yet with a friendly feel to it. Open Sans is secondary headings and ordinary font for the content. Bolded font style was used for the headings and normal for content.</p>

					<h3 class="posttitle">Assumptions and Limitations</h3>
					<hr ALIGN="LEFT"><br>
					<p class="postcontent">All results are hard coded, filter on team listing page is not implemented. Note that immediately after applying, the application status for Weasley's Army will have the "pending" status. Assume that once the player returns to the home page after applying, Weasley's Army has responded to his application and offered him a place as a Beater in their team.<br><br>
					Player will apply for the beater position and accept the offer into Weasley's Army as a beater only for the purposes of this assignment. You can thus only view the team page for Weasley's Army, and you can only apply for Weasley's Army.<br><br>
					Internet connection is required to access the page due to use of google fonts and the online countdown plugin as well as the twitter feed in the sidebar. If the homepage does not appear to render properly (due to the countdown or twitter feed not loading) either reload the page or wait a few seconds for it to finish loading. </p>

					<h3 class="posttitle">Usability Report and Observations</h3>
					<hr ALIGN="LEFT"><br>
					<p class="postcontent">Sensed some hesitation and didn't seem too sure if "join a team" would lead him to the right page to look for teams that are recruiting. Maybe could rename button to "find a team", or put it closer to the "my team applications" so that it will be under the same grouping as they are related actions. <br><br>
					On the join a team page, text colour of apply and "pending" or "declined" are quite similar. Although I tried to differentiate them based on the colour of the row, it still took some time to try and identify the clickable links (i.e. the "apply" link). <br><br>
					Other than these, the user managed to complete the functionality in one go and did not click any wrong buttons. He liked the font choices, and said the popup to apply for a team was very clean.
